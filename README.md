# Clay-Story
An amazing story about Clay
The day seemed to be a great day but sadly turned into a bad one.
Out on a trail ride on a beautiful day without a care in the world.
Only thinking about the surroundings around my horse and I.
Then everything went sideways...
Dear Mom & Dad,

I am the straightest nigga out there
